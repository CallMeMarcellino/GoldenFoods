### Future Plans

- [ ] Let the Golden Bottle of Rum (and similar foods) to be made in a distillery with (in this example) golden cane sugar.
- [ ] Allow villagers to get drunk on Golden Bottle of Rum (and add other special effects to certain foods).
- [ ] Add more ways to obtain certain foods, depending on how you obtain them in the vanilla game.
- [ ] Create a config menu for a mod.

### Building
I'll fully flesh this out later, but you just have to download this whole repository. Then after that, run "build.py". The mod should be added to your game, and you can play with it.

If it doesn't work, then you should join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/xkTjueAsbG). I'll try helping you if you ask me from the "Requests" forum.
